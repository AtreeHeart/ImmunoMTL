## üöÄ Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtreeHeart/ImmunoMTL
cd ImmunoMTL
```

### üìÜ Environment and Dependencies

The model was trained and evaluated on:

## üîç Usage

### Predict with Pretrained Model

```bash
python predict.py --input path/to/input.csv --output path/to/output.csv
```

**Arguments:**

- `--input` : Path to input CSV. Must include a header with two columns:  
  - `Peptide` (e.g., `KTFPPTEPK`)  
  - `MHC` (e.g., `HLA-A*03:01`)  

- `--output` : Output path for predictions in CSV format.

- `--model` *(optional)*: Path to a `.pt` model file. If not provided, default pretrained model is used.
